# Wallpaper Timer
Simple Vale script to change wallpapers from an (any) folder, on an arbitrary interval.

## Set up
- Compile the source with `valac --pkg gio-2.0 /path/to/wallpapertime.vala`
- Run it with the folder with images (wallpapers) as first argument, the switch interval as second argument.
   
  
If it works as desired, set it as a startup command.
