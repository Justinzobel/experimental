# No Previews
Written on request - script to be used under a schortcut key, to switch through all windows on current workspace & monitor, without the visualisation of the previews applet.

###Switch between all windows:
- Set a shortcut to run the script by the command `python3 /path/to/nopreviews.py`

###Switch between windows of current application:
- Set a shortcut to run the script by the command `python3 /path/to/nopreviews.py curr` (or any other argument will do)
