# No Previews
Written on request - script to be used under a schortcut key, to switch through all windows on current workspace & monitor, without the visualisation of the previews applet.

## Set up
- Copy the script somewhere, call it `nopreviews.py`
- Set a shortcut to run the script by the command `python3 /path/to/nopreviews.py`
