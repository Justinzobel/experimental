# Vala QuickNote II applet
This is the Vala version of the similarly named python applet.

# Install
Run from the repo's folder:

- `mkdir build && cd build`

- `meson --buildtype plain --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib`

- `ninja`

- `sudo ninja install`

# Note
Make sure to completely remove previous versions of Quicknote. The targeted folder name is the same as the python version!
